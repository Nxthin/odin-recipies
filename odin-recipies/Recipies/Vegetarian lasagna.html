      <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>3 large carrots</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
      <li>1 medium zucchini</li>
      <li>5 to 6 ounces baby spinach</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>

      <p><strong>For the tomato sauce</strong></p>

      <li>1 large can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>¼ cup roughly chopped fresh basil + additional for garnish</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>2 cups (16 ounces) low-fat cottage cheese, divided</li>
      <li>9 no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        To prepare the veggies: In a large skillet over medium heat, warm the
        olive oil. Once shimmering, add the carrots, bell pepper, zucchini,
        yellow onion, and salt. Cook, stirring every couple of minutes, until
        the veggies are golden on the edges, about 8 to 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Add a few large handfuls of spinach. Cook, stirring frequently, until
        the spinach has wilted. Repeat with remaining spinach and cook until all
        of the spinach has wilted, about 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the
        heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Meanwhile, to prepare the tomato sauce: Pour the tomatoes into a mesh
        sieve or fine colander and drain off the excess juice for a minute.
        Then, transfer the drained tomatoes to the bowl of a food processor. Add
        the basil, olive oil, garlic, salt, and red pepper flakes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Pulse the mixture about 10 times, until the tomatoes have broken down to
        an easily spreadable consistency. Pour the mixture into a bowl for later
        (you should have a little over 2 cups sauce). Rinse out the food
        processor and return it to the machine.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Pour half of the cottage cheese (1 cup) into the processor and blend it
        until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer the mixture to large mixing bowl.
        No need to rinse out the bowl of the food processor this time; just put
        it back onto the machine because you’ll need it later.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Transfer the cooked veggies and spinach mixture to the bowl of the food
        processor. Pulse until they are more finely chopped (but not puréed!),
        about 5 to 7 times, stopping to scrape down the sides as necessary.
        Transfer the mixture to the bowl of whipped cottage cheese. Top with the
        remaining cottage cheese, then add ¼ to ½ teaspoon salt (to taste) and
        lots of freshly ground black pepper. Stir to combine. Now it’s lasagna
        assembly time!

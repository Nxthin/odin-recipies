    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      This recipe consists of a kind of brownie/cake with two main ingredients;
      <strong>chocolate</strong> and <strong>banana</strong>
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>300g Chocolate</li>
      <li>300g Bananas</li>
      <li>150g Sugar</li>
      <li>400g Flour</li>
      <li>50g Yeast</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease a 9×5-inch loaf pan with nonstick
        spray. Set aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        In a large bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt
        together until combined. Mix in 3/4 cup (135g) chocolate chips. Set
        aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk
        attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until
        smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. With the mixer running on medium
        speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
        Then beat in the yogurt, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract until
        combined. Add the dry ingredients and hot water, and beat on low speed
        until combined. Batter is thick. Do not over-mix.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Pour and spread the batter into the prepared baking pan. Sprinkle
        remaining chocolate chips on top, down the center of the loaf.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake for 60–65 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the bread with
        aluminum foil halfway through to prevent the top from drying out. The
        bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean
        with only a few small moist crumbs. This may be after 60–65 minutes
        depending on your oven, so begin checking around the 60-minute mark, at
        5-minute intervals.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Remove the bread from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan set on a
        wire rack for at least 1 to 2 hours before removing, slicing, and
        serving.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Cover and store bread at room temperature for 5 days or in the
        refrigerator for up to 1 week. Banana bread tastes best on day 2 after
        the flavors have settled together.
      </li>
